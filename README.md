# Widget of the Day

Welcome to the **Widget of the Day** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and practicing different Flutter widgets every day. It's a personal learning journey where I experiment with Flutter's rich set of widgets and their functionality, UI design, and integration within mobile apps.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Practice using Flutter widgets.
- Experiment with different layouts, designs, and animations.
- Improve skills in Flutter development through hands-on coding.

## Projects Overview

This repository includes various examples of Flutter widgets. Each day or week, I add new examples demonstrating how different widgets can be used effectively to build engaging UIs.


## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Framework for building natively compiled applications from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: Programming language used by Flutter.
